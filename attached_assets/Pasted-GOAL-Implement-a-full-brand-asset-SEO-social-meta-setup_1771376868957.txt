GOAL:
Implement a full brand asset + SEO/social meta setup for HalloweenVoice.co.uk.

ASSETS (already uploaded by me into /public/images/):
- favicon-16x16.png
- favicon-32x32.png
- favicon-48x48.png
- apple-touch-icon.png (180x180)
- android-chrome-192x192.png
- android-chrome-512x512.png
- halloween-voice-header.png (transparent PNG, used in site header)
- halloween-voice-og.png (1200x630 for Open Graph + WhatsApp + LinkedIn)
- halloween-voice-twitter.png (optional 1200x600; if missing, reuse halloween-voice-og.png)

REQUIREMENTS:
1) Add favicon + app icon tags to the <head> for ALL pages/routes:
   - 16x16, 32x32, 48x48 PNG favicons
   - Apple touch icon 180x180
   - Android 192x192 and 512x512 icons
   - Add a web manifest link if the project has one (optional).

2) Add full Open Graph + Twitter card meta tags site-wide:
   - og:title: "Halloween Voiceover – Spooky, Scary & Funny Character Voices"
   - og:description: "Professional UK Halloween voiceover artist delivering cinematic horror, villains, Ghost Face style, Dracula and more."
   - og:type: "website"
   - og:url: use the canonical URL for the current route
   - og:image: https://halloweenvoice.co.uk/images/halloween-voice-og.png
   - twitter:card: summary_large_image
   - twitter:site and twitter:creator should use: @voiceoverman
   - twitter:image: use halloween-voice-twitter.png if present; otherwise use halloween-voice-og.png

3) Add canonical link tags site-wide:
   - canonical should match the current route and use https://halloweenvoice.co.uk

4) Ensure the meta tags are actually served to crawlers:
   IMPORTANT: If this is an Express/static setup where index.html is served by express.static,
   then implement a small server-side render/HTML injection for the main routes (at least "/")
   so OG tags are not placeholders and are present in the initial HTML response.
   Register HTML route handlers BEFORE express.static so "/" is not intercepted by static middleware.

5) Update the site header to use /images/halloween-voice-header.png as the logo image.
   - Keep it responsive (max-height ~44–52px on desktop, ~36–44px on mobile)
   - Use an <img> with alt="Halloween Voice" and no layout shift.

6) Performance:
   - Add cache headers for /images/ assets (e.g. 30 days) if using Express.
   - Ensure images are not massive; do not inline base64.

OUTPUT:
- Tell me exactly which files you changed.
- Confirm the meta tags by showing the final HTML <head> block (or template partial).
- Confirm that when sharing the homepage URL, the preview image shown is halloween-voice-og.png.
