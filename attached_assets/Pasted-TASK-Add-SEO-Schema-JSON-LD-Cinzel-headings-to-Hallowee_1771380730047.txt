TASK: Add SEO Schema (JSON-LD) + Cinzel headings to HalloweenVoice.co.uk site.

CONTEXT:
This is a one-page Halloween voiceover site with:
- MP3 demo grid
- 4 YouTube embeds
- Contact form (email hidden)
- Brand colours: near-black #0b0b10, red #d42027, subtle purple #7c3aed
- Twitter handle: @voiceoverman
- OG image: /images/halloween-voice-og.png

PART A — CINZEL HEADINGS
1) Add Google Font Cinzel (weights 600/700) to the site:
   - If using HTML head, add <link rel="preconnect"> and the Google Fonts stylesheet.
   - If using CSS import, use @import url(...) at top of main stylesheet.
2) Apply Cinzel ONLY to headings and section titles:
   - h1, h2, h3, and the site logo wordmark text if it's text-based.
   - Keep body text and UI controls (nav, buttons, form inputs) on the existing sans font.
3) Add subtle tracking for headings to feel premium:
   - letter-spacing: 0.02em for h2/h3 (not too much).
4) Ensure headings remain responsive:
   - h1 should still be big and readable on mobile without overflow.
5) Do not change layout or spacing other than what’s needed for font rendering.

PART B — JSON-LD SCHEMA (SITE-WIDE)
Add a single <script type="application/ld+json"> block in the <head> (or server-rendered head) for the homepage with:

Include these schema objects in one JSON-LD array:
1) Organization (or LocalBusiness if you prefer, but Organization is fine)
   - name: "Halloween Voice"
   - url: "https://halloweenvoice.co.uk/"
   - logo: "https://halloweenvoice.co.uk/images/halloween-voice-og.png" (or header logo if you have a square mark)
   - sameAs: include only real profiles if available; include Twitter/X as "https://twitter.com/voiceoverman" at minimum
   - contactPoint:
     - contactType: "sales"
     - availableLanguage: "en-GB"

2) WebSite
   - name: "Halloween Voice"
   - url: "https://halloweenvoice.co.uk/"
   - inLanguage: "en-GB"

3) WebPage
   - @id: "https://halloweenvoice.co.uk/#homepage"
   - url: "https://halloweenvoice.co.uk/"
   - name: "Halloween Voiceover – Spooky, Scary & Funny Character Voices"
   - description: match the meta description
   - primaryImageOfPage: og image
   - isPartOf: WebSite

4) Person (the voiceover talent)
   - name: "Guy Harris"
   - jobTitle: "Voiceover Artist"
   - url: "https://halloweenvoice.co.uk/"
   - sameAs: include Twitter/X as above (and any others only if we actually have them)
   - worksFor: Organization
   - knowsLanguage: "en-GB"

5) ItemList for Audio demos (AudioObject items)
   - For each demo card, output an AudioObject with:
     - name (demo title)
     - description (short descriptor)
     - contentUrl (direct MP3 URL e.g. https://halloweenvoice.co.uk/audio/<file>.mp3)
     - encodingFormat: "audio/mpeg"
   - Wrap the AudioObjects in an ItemList named "Featured Halloween Voice Demos"

6) ItemList for YouTube showcase (VideoObject items)
   - For each of the 4 YouTube videos:
     - name (use a clean title)
     - description (1 line)
     - embedUrl (youtube embed URL)
     - url (canonical YouTube watch URL)
     - thumbnailUrl (YouTube thumbnail if available)
     - uploadDate: include full ISO 8601 with timezone (use a placeholder if unknown but format must be valid, e.g. "2024-10-01T00:00:00+00:00")
   - IMPORTANT: Use correct ISO timestamps (full) for uploadDate.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Do NOT add aggregateRating anywhere.
- Do NOT add Offer schemas for voiceover pricing.
- Ensure schema validates in Google Rich Results Test (no obvious missing required fields).
- Ensure the schema is included in the initial HTML response (server-rendered head if using Express injection).

OUTPUT:
- Show me the exact JSON-LD you added.
- Show me the exact font import you added and the CSS selectors used for headings.
- List every file changed.
