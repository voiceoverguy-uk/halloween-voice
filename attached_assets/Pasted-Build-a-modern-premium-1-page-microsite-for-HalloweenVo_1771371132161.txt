Build a modern, premium 1-page microsite for HalloweenVoice.co.uk. It must be fast, mobile-first, and designed to convert via a contact form (email address hidden).

1) Tech / Structure
	•	Use Node.js + Express.
	•	Serve a static front-end from /public.
	•	Add a server-side contact endpoint at POST /api/contact that sends an email (email address must NOT appear in the front-end code).
	•	Use minimal dependencies.
	•	Site is a single scrolling page with anchored sections and a sticky nav.

Folder structure (required):
	•	/public/index.html
	•	/public/styles.css
	•	/public/script.js
	•	/public/audio/ (place MP3 files here)
	•	/data/demos.json (or /data/demos.js)
	•	/data/videos.json (or /data/videos.js)
	•	/server.js
	•	/public/sitemap.xml
	•	/public/robots.txt

2) Branding / Visual Style

Implement a modern “subtle spooky” look:
	•	Background: near-black #0b0b10
	•	Primary accent red: #d42027
	•	Secondary accent purple: #7c3aed (sparingly, for glow/streak/edge lighting)
	•	Text: off-white / light grey (high contrast, readable)
	•	No clipart. No cheesy Halloween graphics.
	•	Cards: rounded corners, soft shadows, tasteful neon-like edge lighting (purple glow hint).
	•	Typography: modern sans-serif (clean SaaS vibe). Keep headings slightly more dramatic if needed, but still professional.

3) Page Sections (Option A: 1-page with anchors)

Sticky nav with anchor links:
	1.	Hero
	2.	Featured Demos
	3.	YouTube Showcase
	4.	Voice Styles / Use Cases
	5.	Arabella Feature (optional section, include it but keep it compact)
	6.	Credits / Social Proof
	7.	Contact

Each section needs a clear H2 and spacing.

4) Hero Section Content
	•	H1: Halloween Voiceover – Spooky, Scary & Funny Character Voices
	•	One punchy sub-line describing range: comedy → dark → cinematic trailer → theme park scare → radio imaging.
	•	Two CTAs:
	•	Primary: “Listen to Demos” (scrolls to demos section)
	•	Secondary: “Contact / Get a Quote” (scrolls to contact section)
	•	Add a mini trust strip under CTAs with short bullets:
	•	“Broadcast quality”
	•	“Fast turnaround”
	•	“UK-based”
	•	“Source-Nexus available”

5) Featured Demos (MP3 Grid)
	•	Create a card grid like Arabella’s site style.
	•	For NOW, create 4 demo cards so the layout is clear.
	•	All 4 cards use the same placeholder MP3 file:
	•	/public/audio/spooky-showreel-26-guy-harris.mp3
	•	Demo cards must show:
	•	Title
	•	1-line descriptor
	•	Audio player controls with progress bar
	•	Critical behaviour:
	•	Only one demo can play at a time (if another starts, pause the currently playing one).
	•	No autoplay.
	•	Data-driven:
	•	Load demos from /data/demos.json (fetch it client-side).
	•	Each demo item includes: title, description, file.
	•	Adding a demo later must be as simple as: upload MP3 into /public/audio/ and add 1 object into demos.json.

Provide placeholder demo titles/descriptions (4 items) but all using the same MP3 file:
	1.	“Sinister Trailer Villain” — “Deep, cinematic menace”
	2.	“Scream / Ghost Face Style” — “Sharp, intense horror energy”
	3.	“Count Dracula” — “Classic gothic character”
	4.	“Haunted Attraction Announcer” — “Big, bold scare-voice delivery”

6) YouTube Showcase (4 embeds)
	•	Create a responsive 2x2 grid on desktop, stacked on mobile.
	•	Use a lite YouTube embed approach for performance (do not load heavy iframes until interaction). Implement either:
	•	a lightweight custom embed (thumbnail + play button → iframe on click), OR
	•	a minimal “lite-youtube” style component.
	•	For NOW, use the SAME YouTube URL in all 4 slots:
	•	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmMpk16zuSs
	•	Data-driven:
	•	Load video URLs from /data/videos.json.
	•	Each item includes: title (optional) and url.
	•	Must be easy to replace later with 4 real URLs.

7) Voice Styles / Use Cases (Grid)

Create a clean grid of “what you can deliver”, each with 1–2 line max:
	•	Scream / Ghost Face style
	•	Evil villain
	•	Count Dracula
	•	Horror trailers / game trailers
	•	Haunted attraction / in-store
	•	Radio imaging and promos
	•	Funny spooky characters

8) Arabella Feature (compact)

Add a small section titled “Also available: Arabella”.
	•	Short line: “Arabella’s creepy child voice (VOXI/KISS-style).”
	•	Note: “Booked through the same enquiry form.”
	•	Include one small placeholder audio card (can reuse the same MP3 placeholder for now).

9) Credits / Social Proof

Tight, skimmable bullets. Include placeholder items for now:
	•	“Used for Halloween campaigns, radio promos, games, trailers, events”
	•	“Broadcast-quality studio delivery”
	•	Optionally add 2 short placeholder testimonials (clearly marked as placeholders).

10) Contact Form (Email hidden)

Implement a real contact form that sends email server-side.
Front-end fields:
	•	Name (required)
	•	Email (required)
	•	Company (optional)
	•	Message (required)
	•	Honeypot hidden field (spam trap)

Back-end:
	•	POST /api/contact validates inputs.
	•	Add light rate limiting (in-memory is fine).
	•	Send email using Resend (preferred). If not available, use Nodemailer SMTP.
	•	Email destination address must be stored in an environment variable, e.g. CONTACT_TO_EMAIL.
	•	Provide friendly success + error messages.
	•	DO NOT expose the email address anywhere in HTML/JS.

11) SEO + Sharing (must-have)

Must include proper meta tags in index.html:
	•	<title> and meta description (write a good one)
	•	Canonical URL: https://www.halloweenvoice.co.uk/
	•	Open Graph tags: og:title, og:description, og:image (use placeholder image path for now), og:url
	•	Twitter card tags
	•	Include a default OG image path like: /og-halloweenvoice-1200x630.png (placeholder file ok)

Also include:
	•	/public/sitemap.xml (single URL entry for homepage)
	•	/public/robots.txt allowing crawling and pointing to sitemap
	•	One clear H1 and logical H2s.

12) Performance + Accessibility
	•	Mobile must not horizontally “wobble”: lock overflow-x and ensure no elements exceed viewport width.
	•	Buttons and audio controls must be keyboard accessible.
	•	Ensure contrast is readable on near-black background.
	•	Avoid heavy libraries.
	•	Lazy-load anything heavy (especially YouTube).

13) Deliverables
	•	Working local site (Replit run button) with Express server.
	•	All sections present with styling in place.
	•	Demos and videos loaded from data files.
	•	One-audio-at-a-time behaviour working.
	•	Lite YouTube embeds working with the placeholder URL.
	•	Contact form posts to backend and is wired for Resend/SMTP via env vars.

IMPORTANT PLACEHOLDER CONTENT TO USE NOW:
	•	All demo cards use: /public/audio/spooky-showreel-26-guy-harris.mp3
	•	All YouTube embeds use: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmMpk16zuSs

Build it clean, premium, and modern. No novelty Halloween graphics.
